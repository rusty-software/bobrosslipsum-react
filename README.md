# overview

Originally, this site was written in clojurescript. However, I never managed to keep it up to date, and the tooling got to a point where I would have to re-implement (or re-learn) a fair amount just to add new quotes.

Instead of doing that, and since it's currently trendy, I decided to vibe code my way into a reimplementation of this site using react and ChatGPT. The results seem to have turned out alright, although I really haven't checked any of the work critically.

There was a rough spot where the AI fundamentally broke the styling and couldn't figure out how to get it back to a good state. I'm slightly ashamed to admit that I was swearing at it, and while it responded to my frustration, it also reacted... ?positively?, and started swearing in it's replies, like it was excited to talk to me like that. Good times!
